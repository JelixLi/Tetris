`faas-netes` is an OpenFaaS provider which enables Kubernetes for [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas). The existing REST API, CLI and UI are fully compatible.

> OpenFaaS also runs well on managed Kubernetes services like AKS, EKS and GKE. See our list of tutorials in the documentation site for more.

[OpenFaaS (Functions as a Service)](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) is a framework for building serverless functions with Docker and Kubernetes which has first class support for metrics. Any process can be packaged as a function enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

## Reference guide

### Configuration via Environmental variables

faas-netes can be configured with environment variables, but for a full set of options see the [helm chart](./chart/openfaas/).

| Option              | Usage                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `httpProbe`         | Boolean - use http probe type for function readiness and liveness. Default: `false`             |
| `write_timeout`     | HTTP timeout for writing a response body from your function (in seconds). Default: `60s`        |
| `read_timeout`      | HTTP timeout for reading the payload from the client caller (in seconds). Default: `60s`        |
| `image_pull_policy` | Image pull policy for deployed functions (`Always`, `IfNotPresent`, `Never`).  Default: `Always` |
| `gateway.resources`        | CPU/Memory resources requests/limits (memory: `120Mi`, cpu: `50m`) |
| `faasnetes.resources`      | CPU/Memory resources requests/limits (memory: `120Mi`, cpu: `50m`) |
| `operator.resources`       | CPU/Memory resources requests/limits (memory: `120Mi`, cpu: `50m`) |
| `queueWorker.resources`    | CPU/Memory resources requests/limits (memory: `120Mi`, cpu: `50m`) |
| `prometheus.resources`     | CPU/Memory resources requests/limits (memory: `512Mi`)             |
| `alertmanager.resources`   | CPU/Memory resources requests/limits (memory: `25Mi`)              |
| `nats.resources`           | CPU/Memory resources requests/limits (memory: `120Mi`)             |
| `faasIdler.resources`      | CPU/Memory resources requests/limits (memory: `64Mi`)              |
| `basicAuthPlugin.resources`| CPU/Memory resources requests/limits (memory: `50Mi`, cpu: `20m`)  |

### Readiness checking

The readiness checking for functions assumes you are using our function watchdog which writes a .lock file in the default "tempdir" within a container. To see this in action you can delete the .lock file in a running Pod with `kubectl exec` and the function will be re-scheduled.

### Namespaces

By default all OpenFaaS functions and services are deployed to the `openfaas` and `openfaas-fn` namespaces. To alter the namespace use the `helm` chart.

### Ingress

To configure ingress see the `helm` chart. By default NodePorts are used. These are listed in the [deployment guide](https://docs.openfaas.com/deployment).

### Image pull policy

By default, deployed functions will use an [imagePullPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#updating-images) of `Always`, which ensures functions using static image tags are refreshed during an update.
If this is not desired behavior, set the `image_pull_policy` environment variable to an alternative.  `IfNotPresent` is particularly useful when developing locally with minikube.
In this case, you can set your local environment to [use minikube's docker](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/#reusing-the-docker-daemon) so `faas-cli build` builds directly into minikube's image store.
`faas-cli push` is unnecessary in this workflow - use `faas-cli build` then `faas-cli deploy`.

Note: When set to `Never`, **only** local (or pulled) images will work.  When set to `IfNotPresent`, function deployments may not be updated when using static image tags.

## Kubernetes Versions

faas-netes maintainers strive to support as many Kubernetes versions as possible and it is currently compatible with Kubernetes 1.11 and higher. Instructions for OpenShift are also available in the documentation.

## Contributing

You can quickly create a standard development environment using

```sh
make start-kind
```

this will use [KinD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) to create a single node cluster and install the latest version of OpenFaaS via the Helm chart.

Check the contributor guide in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more details on the workflow, processes, and additional tips.
